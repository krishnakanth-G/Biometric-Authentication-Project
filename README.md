# Biometric-Authentication-Project
Biometric Authentication Project using Arduino IDE

Basically this project contains two parts:
1) One is biometric authentication through a particular screen which is fixed to arduino board and connected to fingerprint scanner & ESP8266 which is a low cost Wi-Fi Microcontroller by serial communication.The files required for this module are in serial comm folder. 
2) Later one is biometric authentication through any browser with fingerprint scanner and ESP8266 which is a low cost Wi-Fi Microcontroller with TCP/IP protocol. The files required for this module are in Stored folder.
